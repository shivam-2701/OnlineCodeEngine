## Description

The Express App is a specialized TypeScript-based backend designed to function as a robust code execution engine. Much like services like Judge0, it utilizes containerization to ensure the safe and secure execution of code. Through this technology, the app creates a controlled sandbox environment, guaranteeing the safety and reliability of the backend.

## Features

- **TypeScript Environment**: The entire backend is written in TypeScript, providing enhanced code quality, readability, and error checking.

- **RESTful Architecture**: Adheres to RESTful principles, providing a structured and predictable API for interaction with the frontend.

- **Multi-Language Support**: The backend supports code execution multiple languages, providing flexibility for a wide range of applications, find the list of supported languages below-

## Security Features

The Express app incorporates several security measures to ensure the safety and integrity of data processing:

- **Code Execution Time Limit**: Each code execution is subject to a predefined time limit, preventing potential infinite loops or resource abuse.

- **Containerization**: Docker containers are used to encapsulate code executions, restricting access to the host file system and network resources.

- **Separation of Worker and Server**: A separate microservice, known as the "worker", is responsible for running the code. This decoupling ensures scalability and reliability.

## Getting Started

To set up the Express app locally, follow these steps:

> install docker to continue with the setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shivam-kumar-shah/online-ide-backend
```

2. Build docker-compose:

```bash
  docker compose up
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
  cd server && npm i && cd ..
  cd worker && npm i
```

4. Build docker image:

> cd into worker/docker

```bash
  docker build -t compiler:v7a .
```

5. Generate public/private key pairs for ssh:

> generate and store both the keys in the `server` folder as `server.key` and `server.cert`

6. Start the server and the worker:

> cd into project root

```bash
  cd server && npm run start && cd ..
  cd worker && npm run start
```

## Usage

The app provides a powerful backend for your applications, allowing seamless interaction with the frontend. The use of TypeScript ensures robust code and enhances maintainability.
