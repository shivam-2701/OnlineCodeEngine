# Express App - TypeScript Backend

![online-ide-backend](https://github.com/shivam-kumar-shah/online-ide-backend/assets/134827809/61f47b9b-abc6-4ddb-adc2-34fd5e4c5db8)

## Description

The Express App is a specialized TypeScript-based backend designed to function as a robust code execution engine. Much like services like Judge0, it utilizes containerization to ensure the safe and secure execution of code. Through this technology, the app creates a controlled sandbox environment, guaranteeing the safety and reliability of code execution.

## Features

- **TypeScript Environment**: The entire backend is written in TypeScript, providing enhanced code quality, readability, and error checking.

- **Efficient Routing**: Utilizes Express.js for efficient routing and handling of HTTP requests, ensuring optimal performance.

- **RESTful Architecture**: Adheres to RESTful principles, providing a structured and predictable API for interaction with the frontend.

- **Middleware Implementation**: Leverages Express middleware for tasks such as authentication, request validation, and error handling.

- **Multi-Language Support**: The backend supports code execution in Java, C, C++, and JavaScript, providing flexibility for a wide range of applications.

## Security Features

The Express app incorporates several security measures to ensure the safety and integrity of data processing:

- **Code Execution Time Limit**: Each code execution is subject to a predefined time limit, preventing potential infinite loops or resource abuse.

- **Containerization**: Docker containers are used to encapsulate code executions, restricting access to the host file system and network resources.

- **Separation of Worker and Server**: A separate microservice, known as the "worker", is responsible for running the code. This decoupling ensures scalability and reliability.

## Getting Started

To set up the Express app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [Express App GitHub Repo](https://github.com/your-username/express-app).
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm start`.

## Usage

The Express app provides a powerful backend for your applications, allowing seamless interaction with the frontend. The use of TypeScript ensures robust code and enhances maintainability.

## Technologies Used
